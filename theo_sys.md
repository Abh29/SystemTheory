/***********************************************************************/


## 1. The Concept of A System. Definitions of the system in terms of set theory.

In the context of set theory, a system can be defined as a well-defined collection of objects, which are referred to as elements of the set. The term "well-defined" emphasizes that the collection is clear and distinct, meaning thatthe elements are clearly identified and separated from other elements not included in the set. This concept is fundamental to set theory, which is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with collections of objects, known as sets

The concept of a system in terms of set theory can be defined as follows:

- **Set of Elements (System Elements)**: A system consists of a set of elements that interact with each other and form a unified whole. In terms of set theory, a system is represented as a set of elements.
- **Relationships Between Elements**: Elements within the system are connected by specific relationships or interactions. These relationships can be represented using subsets or other mathematical constructions in set theory.
- **System Boundaries**: The system has clear boundaries that separate it from its surrounding environment. Boundaries can be defined using set theory operations, such as set difference or complement.
- **Purpose or Function of the System**: The system performs certain functions or goals. In terms of set theory, the purpose of the system can be represented as a subset of elements within the system or as an additional property of the set.

Example: Let A be a set representing the system. The elements of this set (A) will be the components of the system. Relationships between elements can be represented using relations within the set. The boundaries of the system can be defined as a subset of A, representing the system itself. The purpose of the system can be expressed as a subset of A, which corresponds to a specific function or goal of the system.



## 2. Definitions of the system in terms of set theory, including a set of input objects affecting the system and a set of output results.

This can be formulated as follows:

- **Set of Input Objects (I)**: Represents the set of all elements that influence the system. These elements may be external variables, factors, or other systems that affect the system under consideration.
- **Set of Output Results (O)**: Represents the set of all results produced by the system in response to the influence of input objects. These results may include changes in the system's state, production of goods, or other output characteristics.
- **Relationships Between Inputs and the System**: Using set theory, one can define relationships between the set of input objects (I) and the set of elements of the system. These relationships may represent interactions, transformations, or other processes occurring within the system.
- **Relationships Between the System and Outputs**: Similarly, relationships between the system and the set of output results (O) can be defined using set theory to reflect how the system generates outputs based on inputs.

Example: Let I be the set of input objects, O the set of output results, and S the set of elements of the system. Then, the system can be defined as a mapping (function) f: I → O, where each input element from I is associated with the corresponding output element from O through the function f. This mapping can be represented in terms of set theory, and the properties of the system can be analyzed using the corresponding operations.




## 3. Definitions of the system in terms of set theory, including a set of input objects affecting the system, a set of output results, as well as a set of properties characterizing both individual elements and the entire system as a whole.

In essence, a system, when defined in terms of set theory, is a well-defined collection of objects (elements) that interact with each other and produce a well-defined collection of outcomes. The system's properties, whether they pertain to individual elements or the system as a whole, can be represented as additional properties or subsets of the set that represents the system. This approach allows for a structured and logical way to define and analyze systems using the principles of set theory 1.

- **Set of Input Objects (I)**: Represents the set of all elements that influence the system. These elements may be external variables, factors, or other systems that affect the system under consideration.
- **Set of Output Results (O)**: Represents the set of all results produced by the system in response to the influence of input objects. These results may include changes in the state of the system, production of goods, or other output characteristics.
- **Set of Properties (P)**: This set describes characteristics of both individual elements of the system and the system as a whole. Properties can be qualitative or quantitative and may include parameters, structure, functions, and other characteristics.
- **Relationships Between Inputs and the System**: Using set theory, one can define relationships between the set of input objects (I) and the set of elements of the system. These relationships may represent interactions, transformations, or other processes occurring within the system.
- **Relationships Between the System and Outputs**: Similarly, relationships between the system and the set of output results (O) can be defined using set theory to reflect how the system generates outputs based on inputs.

Example: Let I be the set of input objects, O the set of output results, and P the set of properties. Then, the system can be defined as a tuple (I, S, O, P), where S represents the set of elements of the system. The elements of the system are characterized by properties from P, and the system as a whole functions as a mapping (function) f: I → O, where each input element is associated with the corresponding output element through the function f. This mapping can be represented in terms of set theory, and the properties of the system can be analyzed using the corresponding operations.



## 4. The definition of a system that includes observers and a set of goals.

- **Set of Input Objects (I)**: Represents the set of all elements that influence the system. These elements may include external factors, data from observers, or other input parameters.
- **Set of Output Results (O)**: This represents the set of all results produced by the system in response to the influence of input objects. The results can be linked to the achievement of system goals.
- **Set of Observers (N)**: Represents the set of subjects observing the system. Observers can influence the system through their observations or feedback.
- **Set of Goals (G)**: This is the set of specific goals or tasks that the system aims to achieve. Goals can be internal or external, and they may change depending on the context.
- **Relationships Between Inputs and the System**: Relationships between the set of input objects (I) and the set of elements of the system can be defined in terms of set theory, taking into account the influence of observers and their impact on the system.
- **Relationships Between the System and Outputs**: Similarly, relationships between the system and the set of output results (O) can be defined, considering the set of goals (G) and the influence of observers.

Example: Let I be the set of input objects, O the set of output results, N the set of observers, and G the set of goals. Then, the system can be defined as a tuple (I, S, O, N, G), where S represents the set of elements of the system. The interactions between system elements and observers, as well as the pursuit of goals, can be formalized using set theory operations and mappings.



## 5. Basic concepts characterizing the system, including concepts that characterize the structure of the system, as well as the functioning and development of the system.

the basic concepts characterizing a system include its elements, structure, functioning, and development. These concepts provide a framework for understanding how systems work, how they are organized, and how they evolve over time.

### Structure of the System:
    - **Elements (or Components)**: The main parts of the system that interact with each other.
    - **Relations (or Relationships)**: The interactions between elements, defining how they influence each other.
    - **Boundaries of the System**: The division between the system and its environment, determining what is part of the system and what is outside of it.

### Functioning of the System:
    - **Inputs and Outputs**: The input data affecting the system and the output results produced by the system in response to these inputs.
    - **Processes (or Functions)**: The activities and internal transformations performed by the system to achieve its goals.

### Development of the System:
    - **Goals and Tasks**: The system's direction, its intentions, and the final results it aims to achieve.
    - **Feedback**: The mechanism allowing the system to adjust its behavior based on the results obtained and information received.
    - **Adaptation**: The system's ability to change and adapt to changes in the environment.

### Dynamic Aspects of the System:
    - **Time and Change**: How the system evolves over time, what processes occur, and how its states change.
    - **Emergence**: The emergence of new properties or characteristics at the system level that cannot be explained by analyzing its individual elements.

### Management of the System:
    - **Control**: The mechanisms and processes used to regulate and correct the system's functioning.
    - **Planning**: The process of determining goals and strategies to achieve these goals.

This definition highlights the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary understanding and analysis in achieving sustainable development. It emphasizes the role of observers in synthesizing insights and identifying effective solutions, reflecting the complexity and interconnectedness of systems within various fields and disciplines 3.



## 6. System status: definition and examples. Input effects, output signals, macro properties of the system. The state space of the system.
The concept of system status in set theory involves understanding the state of a system at a given moment, the effects of inputs on the system, the outputs produced by the system, and the overall properties of the system. Here's a detailed explanation:

- **System Status**: This refers to the specific state of a system at any given moment, determined by the values of its variables, configuration, and current processes. It provides a snapshot of how the system is functioning at that particular point in time.

- **Input Effects**: These are the external data or user interactions that influence the state of the system. In the context of set theory, input effects can be represented as the set of all elements that influence the system, which may include external variables, factors, or other systems affecting the system under consideration.

- **Output Signals**: These are the direct output data or responses from the system. In set theory, the set of output results (O) represents all results produced by the system in response to the influence of input objects. This includes changes in the system's state, production of goods, or other output characteristics.

- **Macro Properties**: These are high-level attributes of the system, such as system load, response time, and overall functionality. In the context of set theory, macro properties can be represented as the set of properties (P) that describe characteristics of both individual elements of the system and the system as a whole. Properties can be qualitative or quantitative and may include parameters, structure, functions, and other characteristics.

- **State Space**: This refers to the full range of possible states that a system can occupy, considering all potential combinations of variable values and configurations. In set theory, the state space of the system is represented as the set of all possible states the system can be in, given its variables and configurations.

For example, in a mechanical rotating system, the energy variables (potential and kinetic energy) are state variables that can be used to develop a state space model [3]. In an electrical system, the voltage across capacitors and current through inductors can be chosen as state variables for developing a state space model [3].

The state space representation of a system is a powerful method for mathematically representing a system, allowing for the analysis and control of the system's behavior [3][4].



## 7. System behavior: definition and examples.
System behavior refers to the change within a system that leads to events in itself or other systems, including actions, reactions, or responses. This concept is rooted in system science, where any system exhibits behavior if its actions are visible to other systems around it. The behavior of a system can be observed in its operational environment, affecting itself or other systems through interactions and feedback loops [1].

Examples of system behavior include:

- **Mechanical Systems**: The oscillations of a pendulum when displaced are a response to external inputs, illustrating how the system reacts to changes.
- **Electrical Systems**: The charging and discharging of a capacitor in response to a voltage source demonstrate dynamic changes in charge, showcasing the system's behavior.
- **Economic Systems**: Economic cycles, such as booms and recessions, respond to various economic factors, exhibiting cyclical behavior.
- **Biological Systems**: Animals regulate their body temperature in response to environmental changes, highlighting the system's ability to adapt.
- **Information Systems**: Data transmission across a network, including delays and packet loss, exemplify the behavior of information systems in processing and transmitting data [2].

Understanding system behavior is crucial for systems engineering and design, as it informs the process of designing systems to predict and influence their behavior over time. This knowledge is essential for identifying how to effect change and the likely outcomes of interventions, both desirable and undesirable. The behavior of systems can be influenced by feedback loops, emergent properties, and the complexity of the system, which can be either simple or dynamically complex [2].



## 8. Equilibrium of the system: definition and examples.

Equilibrium in a system refers to a state of balance or stability, where the opposing or competing influences within the system are in equilibrium, meaning they are in a state of balance such that there is no net change. This concept is applicable across various fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and economics, among others.

Examples of system equilibrium include:
1. Mechanical system:
   - A stationary body: If the friction force, gravitational force, and other external influences are zero, the body remains in static equilibrium, not subject to acceleration or noticeable changes.
2. Electrical system:
   - An electrical circuit in a static state: If the voltage and current in the circuit remain constant over time, the system is in static equilibrium.
3. Economic system:
   - Market price equilibrium: If supply and demand on the market are balanced, a price equilibrium is established, where market forces do not lead to changes.
4. Biological system:
   - A body at rest: When an organism is not subjected to physical or chemical influences, the body system may be in static equilibrium.
5. Ecological system:
   - Ecological equilibrium: In an ecosystem, if species populations are balanced, and resources are distributed in such a way that there are no significant changes in biological diversity or structure, the system is considered in equilibrium.
6. Physical system:
   - Thermodynamic equilibrium: If the system is in a state where its thermodynamic parameters, such as temperature and pressure, remain constant, it is in thermodynamic equilibrium [6].



## 9. System stability: definition and examples.
System stability refers to the property of a system to return to its equilibrium state after being disturbed, either by moving closer to or away from its equilibrium position. A system in stable equilibrium tends to return to or oscillate about its original equilibrium state when disturbed, while an unstable system continues to move away from its equilibrium state when disturbed.

**Examples of system stability:**
1. Mechanical system:
   - Stability of a ball in a depression: If a ball is placed in a concave depression, the system is stable because the ball will return to the center of the depression after small displacements.
2. Electrical system:
   - Stability of an electrical network: A stable electrical system can maintain constant voltage and current in response to changes in load or external conditions.
3. Economic system:
   - Financial stability: A stable economic system is capable of recovering from financial crises and maintaining stability under changing conditions.
4. Biological system:
   - Homeostasis in the body: The stability of a biological system is ensured by homeostasis, which maintains the consistency of the internal environment of the organism.
5. Ecological system:
   - Ecological stability: Stable ecosystems can cope with changes in climate, biodiversity, and other factors, minimizing negative consequences.


Stability vs. Equilibrium:
Equilibrium is a state of balance within a system, where the internal forces and external forces are in balance, and the system is not changing over time. It is a static state of the system.
Stability refers to the system's ability to return to its equilibrium state after being disturbed. A stable system can be in equilibrium but will return to its equilibrium state when disturbed, while an unstable system will not return to its equilibrium state after being disturbed and will instead continue to move away from it.



## 10. The scheme of the system with a single feedback. Examples.
A system with a single feedback is a structure where a part or all of the output signal is returned to the input with a certain feedback coefficient. This creates a feedback loop that can influence the dynamics and characteristics of the system. Schematically, such a system can be represented by the following block diagram:

In this scheme:
- The system takes an input signal.
- A part of the output signal is returned to the system's input through a summing block with a feedback coefficient.

**Examples:**
1. Sound amplifier with feedback:
   - Structure: The amplifier takes an audio signal at the input, amplifies it, and sends it to the output. A part of the output signal is returned to the input through the feedback path.
   - Purpose: Ensuring linearity and stability of amplification.
2. Regulated current source:
   - Structure: The current source maintains a constant current at the output. A part of the output current is returned to the input through the feedback path.
   - Purpose: Stabilizing the output current under changing parameters.
3. Thermostat:
   - Structure: The thermostat regulates the temperature in a room. When the temperature rises, the heater is turned on. A part of the heat is returned to the temperature sensor.
   - Purpose: Maintaining a set temperature level in the room.

Feedback plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of control systems by allowing the system to adjust its output based on the difference between the desired output and the actual output. This adjustment can improve stability, accuracy, and speed of the system's response to changes, and it can minimize overshoot and oscillations [1][3][4].



## 11. Stratification as a means of detailing the description of the system.

Stratification in systems, particularly in the context of social systems, refers to the process of dividing a system into layers or strata for a more detailed and structured analysis. This method aids in simplifying complex systems, making them more comprehensible and manageable. When describing a system, stratification can be employed to highlight the main components and their interconnections.

**The process of stratification:**
1. **Determining levels**: Identifying the main levels or layers into which the system can be divided. These levels can represent functional blocks, subsystems, or other logical components.
2. **Division into subsystems**: Each level is further divided into subsystems or elements, creating a hierarchy. This allows for a deeper understanding of the system's structure and the identification of key components.
3. **Describing interactions**: Determining the interactions between components at different levels. This includes describing the flow of information, energy, materials, and other significant interactions.
4. **Analyzing each level**: Conducting a detailed analysis at each level, taking into account the internal structure and functionality of each subsystem.

In the context of social stratification, this method can be applied to societal structures to understand how individuals and groups are organized and differentiated based on factors such as wealth, income, education, family background, and power. Social stratification can be either open or closed, with open systems allowing for more movement and interaction between layers and classes, while closed systems accommodate little change in social position [0][1][2][4].



## 12. The structure of the system. Types of structures.
The structure of a system reflects the organization of its components and their interconnections. Examining the structure of a system allows us to understand how components interact with each other and how its functioning is ensured. The types of system structures can vary depending on the characteristics and properties of the system.

**Types:**
1. **Hierarchical Structure:**
   - **Description:** The system is organized in a hierarchical manner, where higher levels include more abstract and general components, while lower levels represent more detailed elements.
   - **Example:** The organizational structure of a company, where the top management levels are at the top, and the lower levels are individual departments and employees.

2. **Network Structure:**
   - **Description:** The system is a network of interconnected components, where each element can be connected to several others.
   - **Example:** An information network, where computers are connected by a network, ensuring data transmission between them.

3. **Functional Structure:**
   - **Description:** The system is organized functionally, where components are divided by the functions they perform.
   - **Example:** A car, where various components (engine, braking system, electronics) are responsible for different functions.

4. **Processor Structure:**
   - **Description:** The system is organized around a central element or processor, which manages and coordinates the work of other components.
   - **Example:** A computer system, where the central processor (CPU) coordinates the work of other devices.

5. **Topological Structure:**
   - **Description:** The system is organized with consideration for the physical location and interconnections between components.
   - **Example:** The structure of a network, where the physical connection of nodes determines the topology (star, ring, bus).

6. **Loosely Coupled Structure:**
   - **Description:** The components of the system have limited interconnections, allowing them to function independently of each other.
   - **Example:** A software architecture, where different parts can be developed and modified independently.



## 13. Network structures: definition and examples.

**Definition:**
Network structures represent the organization of a system as a network, where components are interconnected. In such a structure, each element can be connected to several others, and changes in one component can affect others. This ensures a more flexible and adaptive system.

**Examples:**
1. **Information Network:**
   - **Description:** Computers and other devices are connected by a network, ensuring data exchange.
   - **Example:** Local networks in offices, global networks like the Internet.
2. **Transportation Network:**
   - **Description:** Cities, roads, and other elements are connected by a network to provide transportation infrastructure.
   - **Example:** Road and highway systems in a city.
3. **Electrical Network:**
   - **Description:** Distribution of electricity through connected power substations, transmission lines, and distribution networks.
   - **Example:** National electrical grids providing power supply.
4. **Telecommunication Network:**
   - **Description:** Combining various types of communication (voice, data, video) through a network.
   - **Example:** Mobile and wired telephone networks.

## 14. Hierarchical structures: definition and examples.
**Definition:**
Hierarchical structures represent the organization of a system in a hierarchy, where components are divided into levels, and each level provides more abstract or general elements. At the top of the hierarchy is the highest level, with lower levels below it, each refining and detailing elements from the previous level.

**Examples:**
1. **Company Organizational Structure:**
   - **Description:** Representation of the organization as a hierarchy with different levels, starting from top management and descending to operational staff.
   - **Example:** The highest level - CEO, followed by departments (finance, marketing, production), then divisions, individual employees.

2. **File System Hierarchy:**
   - **Description:** The structure of a computer file system, where folders and files are organized in levels of hierarchy.

3. **Project Management:**
   - **Description:** Organization of a project in a hierarchy, where different levels represent stages, tasks, and subtasks.
   - **Example:** The highest level - Project, followed by stages (planning, execution, control), then tasks and subtasks for each stage.

4. **Scientific Classification Hierarchy:**
   - **Description:** Classification of organisms and species in biology organized in a hierarchy, starting from the kingdom and ending with the species.
   - **Example:** The highest level - Kingdom, followed by Type, then Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.

5. **Computer Network Structure:**
   - **Description:** Organization of a computer network with division into levels, from computing nodes to network devices.
   - **Example:** The highest level - Local network (LAN), followed by subnets, then computers and devices in each subnet.



## 15. Multilevel hierarchical structures, strata and echelon: definition and examples.
**Definition:**
Multilevel hierarchical structures represent the organization of a system with more than two levels of hierarchy. This means the presence of several levels, where each subsequent level represents more specific and detailed elements than the previous one.

**Examples:**
1. **Educational System:**
   - **Description:** A hierarchy of the educational system with several levels, starting from higher education and ending with primary school.
   - **Example:** The highest level - University, the next level - Faculties, then - Courses, Groups, Individual Students.

2. **Enterprise Information System:**
   - **Description:** A hierarchy in a company's information system reflecting various levels of management and their access to data.

3. **Ecological Hierarchy:**
   - **Description:** Organization of an ecosystem in a hierarchy with different levels, starting from a biome and ending with individual species.
   - **Example:** The highest level - Biome, the next level - Ecosystem, then - Populations, Organisms, Species.

**Strata:**
**Definition:**
Strata represent layers or levels in a system, where each layer has its own characteristics and functions. This approach allows for the systematization of information and its management at different levels.

**Examples of Strata:**
1. **Geological Strata:**
   - **Description:** Layers of rock formations, arranged horizontally or vertically, representing different geological periods.
   - **Example:** A layer of Jurassic deposits followed by a layer of Triassic deposits.

2. **Social Strata:**
   - **Description:** Social layers in society, representing different levels of income, education, and social status.
   - **Example:** The highest social layer - wealthy and influential individuals, the next layer - the middle class, then - the lower layer of the population.

**Echelon:**
**Definition:**
An echelon represents a group or layer of people or objects, arranged in a line or vertically. This term can also be used to denote a level of responsibility or influence.

**Examples of Echelons:**
1. **Echelons in an Organization:**
   - **Description:** Division of employees by hierarchy levels of responsibility and management within an organization.
   - **Example:** The highest echelon - Top management, the next echelon - Department managers, then - Working staff.

2. **Echelons in a Military Structure:**
   - **Description:** Division of military personnel by levels of responsibility and command.
   - **Example:** The highest echelon - Generals and admirals, the next echelon - Officers, then - Enlisted soldiers.


 while both strata and echelons describe levels within a hierarchical system, strata focus on the organization and categorization of components into layers or levels, and echelons focus on the sequence or rank of positions within the hierarchy.

## 19. Stratified representation of the system as a means of its detailing.
The stratified representation of a system is a method of detailing or organizing the system into layers or strata. This approach is particularly useful in systems that are complex and require a more structured way to analyze or understand their components and their interactions.

**Process of Stratified Representation:**
1. **Identifying Levels**: The first step in stratified representation is to identify the main levels or layers into which the system can be divided. These levels can represent functional blocks, subsystems, or other logical components that make up the system.
2. **Dividing into Subsystems**: Each level is further divided into subsystems or elements, creating a hierarchy. This division allows for a deeper understanding of the system's structure and the identification of key components.
3. **Describing Interactions**: The next step involves determining the interactions between components at different levels. This includes describing the flow of information, energy, materials, and other significant interactions within the system.
4. **Analyzing Each Level**: Finally, a detailed analysis is conducted at each level, taking into account the internal structure and functionality of each subsystem.

This method is beneficial for simplifying complex systems, making them more comprehensible and manageable. It aids in identifying the main components and their interactions, which is crucial for understanding the overall functioning of the system. Stratified representation can be applied in various fields, including mechanical design, computer science, and database management, where it helps in organizing data and systems into a more structured and understandable format [Source  3].


## 20. Matrix structures, strong and weak connections: definition and examples.
Matrix structures, particularly within the context of organizational structures, refer to a hybrid approach that combines elements of both functional and projectized structures. This type of structure is beneficial for organizations operating in dynamic environments, offering flexibility and efficiency in managing resources and projects.

**Types of Matrix Organizational Structures:**

1. **Strong Matrix Structure**: In a strong matrix organizational structure, project managers have full authority and a full-time role, controlling the budget and having a full-time project management team reporting to them. This setup shares characteristics with a projectized organization. The functional manager's role is minimal, focusing more on the functional aspects of the project.
2. **Weak Matrix Structure**: Conversely, in a weak matrix organizational structure, project managers have limited authority, often part-time, with no administrative staff reporting directly to them. Their role is more akin to a coordinator or an expediter. The functional manager controls the project budget and has a more significant role in the project's execution.
3. **Balanced Matrix**: A balanced matrix shares authority equally between the functional and project managers. This structure fosters collaboration and allows for a more balanced approach to managing resources and projects.

**Examples of Matrix Structures:**

1. **Strong Matrix Example**: The development of a new software product, where the project manager has full control over the team, including resources, budget, and decision-making, with functional managers providing support.
2. **Weak Matrix Example**: The construction of a new company branch, where functional managers retain control over resources, and the project manager focuses on coordinating tasks and achieving project goals.
3. **Balanced Matrix Example**: The development of a new product with equal involvement from project and functional management. Both managers have power and influence on the project, with resources allocated evenly.

Matrix organizational structures are particularly beneficial in industries requiring cross-functional collaboration, quick resource reprioritization, and managing large or complex projects that require multiple skill sets [0][1][3].



## 21. Principles of classification of systems.

The principles of classification help organize and structure various types of systems for more effective understanding and management of them.

**Main principles of classification of systems:**
1. **By nature:**
   - **Physical systems:** Exist in physical space, have specific material components (e.g., machines, cars).
   - **Abstract systems:** Exist as concepts or ideas, do not have material components (e.g., mathematical models, social structures).

2. **By structure:**
   - **Simple systems:** Consist of a small number of elements with a limited number of interactions (e.g., a mechanism with several parts).
   - **Complex systems:** Contain numerous elements, interacting in complex and often unpredictable ways (e.g., ecosystems, social networks).

3. **By behavior:**
   - **Dynamic systems:** Their states change over time (e.g., the motion of a planet around its orbit).
   - **Static systems:** States remain constant over time (e.g., the static structure of a building).

4. **By scale:**
   - **Macro systems:** Studied at the level of extensive complexes or organizations (e.g., the economy of a country).
   - **Micro systems:** Studied at the level of individual elements or details (e.g., individual components in an electronic device).

5. **By management characteristics:**
   - **Open systems:** Exchange matter and energy with the surrounding environment (e.g., the human body).
   - **Closed systems:** Isolated from the surrounding environment and do not exchange it (e.g., a thermos with liquid).

6. **By functionality:**
   - **Technical systems:** Created to perform specific technical tasks (e.g., a car).
   - **Social systems:** Organized for interaction and joint activity of people (e.g., society).



## 22. Open and closed systems. Examples.

1. **Open Systems:**
   - **Definition:** Systems that exchange matter and energy with the surrounding environment.
   - **Examples:**
   - **Ecosystem:** Plants and animals interact with air, water, and other elements of the surrounding environment.
   - **Company:** Acquiring raw materials, producing goods, and interacting with the market.

2. **Closed Systems:**
   - **Definition:** Systems that are isolated from the external environment and do not exchange matter or energy.
   - **Examples:**
   - **Thermos with Liquid:** Isolated from the surrounding environment, preserving the heat of the liquid inside.
   - **Closed Gas Bottle:** The gas inside the bottle is isolated from external air.



## 23. Classification of systems by complexity

Classification of systems by complexity typically involves dividing systems into categories based on the number and complexity of interactions between their elements.

**Main Categories:**
1. **Small Systems (10 -  10^3 elements):**
   - Example: A small mechanical system, including several parts and mechanisms.
2. **Complex Systems (10^4 –  10^6 elements):**
   - Example: A production line with a large number of machines and equipment.
3. **Ultra-complex Systems (10^7 –  10^30 elements):**
   - Example: A large ecological complex, including various species of animals, plants, soil, and climate conditions.
4. **Super-complex Systems (10^30 –  10^200 elements):**
   - Example: The universe with numerous galaxies, stars, and planets.

This classification provides a structured way to understand and manage the complexity of systems, from simple mechanical devices to vast ecosystems and the universe itself. Each category represents a different level of complexity, with systems at the lower end being relatively straightforward and those at the higher end being incredibly complex and interconnected [Source  0][Source  1][Source  3].



## 24. A large system. Examples.

The term "big system" is typically used to describe a system that encompasses numerous elements, components, or subsystems, making it complex and extensive. Here are several examples of large systems:

1. **Global Transportation System:**
   - **Characteristics:** Includes various types of transport (cars, trains, planes, ships), logistics centers, roads, and ports, as well as related technologies and infrastructure.
   - **Example:** The global network of roads, airports, and ports, united to ensure international transportation.

2. **The Internet:**
   - **Characteristics:** Consists of billions of connected devices, servers, cables, and wireless technologies.
   - **Example:** The Internet includes websites, social networks, cloud computing, streaming video, and many other services.

3. **Energy Network:**
   - **Characteristics:** Includes power plants, power grids, substations, and distribution systems.
   - **Example:** The global energy infrastructure that provides the production and transmission of electricity.

4. **Global Ecosystem:**
   - **Characteristics:** Includes various biological systems, climate zones, and interactions between species.
   - **Example:** Global ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest, oceans, and deserts, interacting with each other and with climate conditions.

5. **State Administrative System:**
   - **Characteristics:** Includes governmental institutions, authorities, social services, and legal structures.
   - **Example:** The state system of the United States, including federal, state, and local levels of government.



## 25. Estimates of the complexity of the systems. Examples.

The assessment of system complexity often does not reduce to a simple mathematical formula. In the context of systems engineering and operations research, certain metrics can be used to evaluate complexity. However, note that these metrics can be context-dependent and may not always be easily expressed in a mathematical formula.

Several metrics and examples are as follows:

1. **Number of Elements (N):**
   - **Metric:** A simple counting metric representing the total number of elements in the system.
2. **Complexity of Structure Interconnections (C):**
   - **Metric:** A measure of complexity based on the number and complexity of interconnections between elements.
3. **Level of Abstraction (A):**
   - **Metric:** A measure characterizing the level of abstraction in the system.
4. **Dynamism of the System (D):**
   - **Metric:** A measure of dynamism and variability within the system.
5. **Ability to Self-Organize (SO):**
   - **Metric:** An assessment of the system's ability to change its structure and behavior.
6. **Level of Manageability (M):**
   - **Metric:** An assessment of how easily the system can be managed and controlled.

In the provided formulas for assessing system complexity, two different approaches are used:

1. **Quantitative Assessment of System Complexity (Cs):**
   - **Formula:** Cs = m / n, where (m) is the number of connections, and (n) is the number of elements in the system.
2. **Entropy Approach to Structural Complexity (Is):**
   - **Formula:** Is = -  Σ (p(s_i) * log2(p(s_i))), where (p(s_i)) is the probability of a property with number (i) appearing in the system.

These metrics and formulas provide a structured way to quantify and analyze the complexity of systems, aiding in the design and management of complex systems.



## 26. Big and complicated: comparison. Examples.

The terms "big" and "complex" can be used in different contexts, and their comparison depends on the specific aspect or characteristic of the system in question. Let's examine the comparison between "big" and "complex," providing examples for each.

1. **Size and Number of Elements:**
   - **Big System:** Refers to a system with a large number of elements or components.
   - **Complex System:** Relates to a system where the interactions and structure between elements are complex.
   - **Example:** A global transportation system can be considered big if looking at the number of transportation means, and complex if considering the complex routes, logistics, and interactions between different types of transport.

2. **Interconnections and Complexity of Structure:**
   - **Big System:** Refers to a system with a large number of elements.
   - **Complex System:** Refers to a system where the interconnections and structure are complex.
   - **Example:** A city's gas supply system can be considered big if considering the number of homes and businesses, and complex due to the complex piping networks and regulation systems.

The distinction between "big" and "complex" systems lies in the nature of their size and complexity. A big system is large in terms of its scale or number of elements, while a complex system is characterized by the complexity of its interconnections and structure.


## 27. A large and complex system: the observer.

The concepts of "big" and "complex" systems are associated with the concept of an "observer" for studying these systems. To study a big system, one "observer" is needed (this does not refer to the number of people participating in the study or design of the system but rather to the relative homogeneity of their qualifications, such as an engineer or economist), while to understand a complex system, several "observers" with fundamentally different qualifications are needed (for example, a mechanical engineer, a programmer, a computer technician, an economist, possibly a lawyer, psychologist, etc.).



## 28. Quantitative assessment of the complexity of a system with n elements and m connections.

The quantitative formula for assessing the complexity of a system is given by the ratio of the number of connections to the maximum possible number of connections in a fully connected system without feedback loops. Thus, \( C_s \) provides a measure of the structural complexity of the system, and the higher the value, the more complex the system is considered.

**Definition of Terms:**
- **Complexity (\( C_s \))**: A measure of the structural complexity of a system, indicating how interconnected the components of the system are. It is calculated as the ratio of the actual number of connections (\( n \)) to the maximum possible number of connections in a fully connected system without feedback loops (\( n_{max} \)). The formula for \( C_s \) is:

C_s = m / n(n-1)

- **Connections m**: The actual number of interconnections or links between the components of the system.
- **Maximum Possible Connections n_{max} = n (n-1)**: The maximum number of connections that could exist in a fully connected system without any feedback loops. This represents the theoretical limit of how interconnected the components of the system can be.
- **element count n**: is the number of components of the system

This formula helps in quantifying the complexity of a system by comparing its actual interconnections to the maximum possible interconnections in a fully connected system. The higher the value of \( C_s \), the more complex the system is considered, indicating a higher level of structural complexity [Source  3].



## 29. Functional complexity of the system.

The functional complexity of a system reflects the difficulty in creating, understanding, testing, and maintaining its functions. This complexity can be caused by various factors, such as the volume of functionality, the interconnection of functions, the level of abstraction, as well as the complexity of the algorithms and data used in the system. The assessment of functional complexity of a system can be based on the following factors:

1. **Volume of Functionality:**
   - Related to the number and variety of functions the system performs.
   - The higher the required functionality from the system, the higher its functional complexity.

2. **Interconnection of Functions:**
   - Considers the interdependencies and interaction between different functions of the system.
   - If functions are closely related and depend on each other, this can increase functional complexity.

3. **Level of Abstraction:**
   - Reflects the level of detail and abstraction of functions in the system.
   - Systems with a high level of abstraction may be harder to understand and develop.

4. **Complexity of Algorithms and Data:**
   - Systems using complex algorithms and data structures can be functionally complex.
   - Complexity in algorithms and data also affects the performance and efficiency of the system.

5. **Flexibility and Scalability:**
   - Reflects the system's ability to easily adapt to changes in functional requirements.
   - Greater flexibility and scalability can introduce additional levels of complexity.




## 30. Dynamic complexity of the system.

Dynamic complexity is the result of interactions within a system with temporal delays. Time delays between decision-making and results slow down the process of accumulating experience, testing hypotheses, and improving the system.
Example: playing chess.

Key aspects of dynamic complexity include:

1. **Temporal Dependence:** The system's behavior and structure change over time in response to internal and external influences. This can involve changes in the system's state, the emergence of new components, or the alteration of existing connections.
2. **Feedback Loops:** Dynamic systems often contain feedback loops, where the output of a component or subsystem influences its input. This can lead to oscillations, cycles, or transient states, adding another layer of complexity to the system's behavior.
3. **Adaptability:** The ability of the system to adapt to changes in the environment or inputs is a significant aspect of dynamic complexity. Systems with high dynamic complexity can adjust their structure or behavior to maintain stability or achieve goals in response to external or internal changes.
4. **Emergent Properties:** Dynamic systems often exhibit emergent properties, where the overall behavior of the system cannot be predicted solely from the properties of the individual components. The collective behavior arises from the interactions between components and the system's response to external stimuli.
5. **Nonlinear Dynamics:** Many dynamic systems exhibit nonlinear behavior, where small changes in input can lead to significant changes in output. This can make the system's behavior unpredictable and complex.

Dynamic complexity is particularly prevalent in systems such as ecosystems, economies, social networks, and technological systems like computer networks and software systems. Understanding and managing dynamic complexity is crucial for effective system design, control, and optimization, as it can significantly impact the system's performance, stability, and adaptability.


## 31. Small, large, simple, complex systems are examples.
1. **Small Systems:**
   - **Example:** A clock with a mechanism. It consists of a limited number of parts and performs a specific function - showing time.

2. **Large Systems:**
   - **Example:** The global Internet infrastructure. This is a combination of billions of computers and other devices worldwide for the exchange of information.

3. **Simple Systems:**
   - **Example:** A motion sensor in a house. This device has limited functionality and simply reacts to movement, sending a signal about it.

4. **Complex Systems:**
   - **Example:** The transportation system of a large city. Includes numerous interconnected elements such as roads, public transport, traffic lights, and traffic management systems.

5. **Small and Complex Systems:**
   - **Example:** A small microcontroller with a program and several connected sensors. It can be small in size, but complex in its functionality.

6. **Large and Simple Systems:**
   - **Example:** A production line with identical machines performing the same task. Each machine is simple in its function, but their number forms a large system.



## 32. Classification of systems by degree of organization.

1. **Well-Organized Systems:**
   - **Description:** These systems have a clear and stable structure. The internal elements interact in an organized and predictable manner.
   - **Example:** An industrial robot that performs a specific task within strictly defined parameters.

2. **Poorly Organized Systems (Diffuse):**
   - **Description:** These systems may have an undefined or weakly structured organization. Interaction between elements may be less predictable.
   - **Example:** Many social networks, where information and interaction can be diffuse and non-obvious.

3. **Self-Organizing or Evolving Systems:**
   - **Description:** These systems have the ability to change their structure, adapt to changing conditions, and evolve over time without external management.
   - **Example:** A forest ecosystem, where elements (plants, animals) interact and can self-regulate their population and interaction.


## 33. Well-organized systems. Examples.
Well-organized systems:
- **Description:** These systems have a clear and stable structure. The internal elements interact in an organized and predictable manner.
- **Example:** An industrial robot that performs a specific task within strictly defined parameters.


## 34. Poorly organized systems. Examples.
Poorly organized systems (diffuse):
- **Description:** These systems may have an undefined or weakly structured organization. The interaction between elements can be less predictable.
- **Example:** Many social networks, where information and interaction can be diffuse and non-obvious.


## 35. Self–organizing systems are the main properties. Examples.
Self-organizing systems have the ability to organize and structure their components without external management.

**Main properties:**
1. **Autonomy:**
   - **Example:** An anthill, where ants act autonomously, resulting in a complex structure of the anthill.
2. **Local Interactions:**
   - **Example:** The behavior of a flock of birds or fish, where individuals follow simple rules, but together create complex formations.
3. **Adaptability:**
   - **Example:** A network of neurons in the brain, which can change its structure in response to new experiences and tasks.
4. **Emergence:**
   - **Example:** Swarm behavior of bees, where the overall goal of the swarm can emerge from the local actions of each bee.
5. **Dynamic Stability:**
   - **Example:** A forest ecosystem, which is capable of recovering after natural disasters or climate changes.



## 36. Measuring the amount of information is the Hartley formula.
Hartley proposed to determine the information I pertaining to one message by taking the logarithm of the total number of possible messages N:
      
      I = log₂(N)

For example: If we have a system where there are  8 equally probable outcomes (for example,  8 different symbols or states), then the amount of information for each of these outcomes will be:
I = log₂(8) = 3 bits

If, however, the entire set of possible messages consists of just one (N = m =  1), then I = log2(1) = 0, which corresponds to the absence of information in this case. 
When there are independent sources of information with N1 and N2 numbers of possible messages:
N = N1 * N2
I = log₂(N) = log₂(N1 * N2) = log₂(N1) + log₂(N2) = I1 + I2 

This formula allows for the quantification of the amount of information contained in a message based on the number of possible messages and the length of the message, under the assumption that all messages are equiprobable 


## 37. Shannon's formula for measuring the total amount of information.
Shannon's formula is used to measure entropy and the amount of information in a system. This formula was developed by Claude Shannon. The formula looks as follows:

H(X) = - ∑ᵢp(xi) log(p(xi))

where:
- H(X) is the entropy of the random variable X,
- p(xi)is the probability of outcome xi ,
- xi  are the possible outcomes of the random variable X.

Shannon's formula allows for the estimation of the average "uncertainty" (or "degree of chaos") in a system. The higher the entropy, the less predictable the system is, and therefore, the more information is required to describe its state [Source  0][Source  4].



## 38. The entropy of the system.
Entropy in the context of information theory, introduced by Claude Shannon, measures the degree of uncertainty or "disorder" in a system. Entropy is a measure of the average information needed to describe the state of the system. The formula for calculating entropy (H) in a system, where X is a random variable with n possible states, is given as follows:

H(X) = - ∑ᵢp(xi) log(p(xi))

**Main Ideas Related to Entropy:**
1. **High Entropy:**
   - High entropy indicates a high degree of uncertainty or randomness in the system.
   - Example: A random sequence of bits in a computer memory has high entropy because each bit is equally likely to be either  0 or  1.

2. **Low Entropy:**
   - Low entropy suggests a system that is more predictable or ordered.
   - Example: A document that is sorted alphabetically has low entropy because the sequence of characters is highly predictable.

3. **Entropy and Information:**
   - Entropy can be seen as a measure of the amount of information needed to describe the state of a system.
   - Higher entropy systems require more information to describe accurately, while systems with lower entropy can be described with less information.



## 39. Entropy of a system with equally possible states.

If the system has equally possible states, then the probability of each state P(xi) is the same for all states. In this case, the formula for calculating entropy is simplified.

H(X) = - ∑ᵢp(xi) log(p(xi)) = - ∑ᵢ1/n log(1/n) = log(n)


## 40. The theorem on the maximum entropy of a system with a finite set of states.
The Entropy of a system is maximum when all the elements of the system have the same probability i.e H(X) = log(n)
If the probability of one of the n states of the system being equal to  1, then the entropy is equal to  0. The entropy of a system with equally possible states is equal to the logarithm of the number of states:

H(X) <= log(n)

**Example  1:**
Determine the maximum possible entropy of a system consisting of three elements, each of which can be in four possible states.
n = 4 * 4 * 4 = 64  => H(x) = log2(64) = 6

**Example  2:**
Determine the maximum possible entropy of a message consisting of  5 letters, where the total number of letters in the alphabet is equal to  32.
n = 32⁵  => H(X) = log(32⁵) = 5 * log(32) = 25


## 41. Proof of the maximum entropy theorem of a system with a finite set of states.
we need to prove that H(X) <= log(n)

let the <X: {Px| x in X}> a set where Px is the probability of the variable x in X, and |X| = n and ∑Px = 1

H(X) - log(n) = ∑ Px * log(1/Px) - log(n) = ∑Px*log(1/Px) + ∑Px*log(n)  sinse log(n) is a constantce and the sum of Px is 1
then H(X) - log(n) = ∑ Px * log(1/nPx)  <=   ∑Px (1/nPx - 1) <= ∑1/n - ∑Px <= 0   since log(x) <= x - 1 
then H(x) <= log(n)

further more for H(X) == log(n) ==> log(1/nPx) == 1/nPx - 1   ==> 1/nPx = 1 ==> Px = 1/n


## 42. How to determine the maximum possible entropy of a system consisting of n elements, each of which can be in m possible states.
To determine the maximum possible entropy of a system consisting of \(n\) elements, each of which can be in \(m\) possible states, you would follow a process that involves identifying the various states the system can exist in and the parameters involved in any constraints. The principle of maximum entropy suggests that the probability distribution that best represents the current state of knowledge about a system is the one with the largest entropy, considering precisely stated prior data or testable information.

For a system with \(n\) elements and \(m\) possible states, the total number of possible states (\(M\)) is \(m^n\). This is because each of the \(n\) elements can be in any of the \(m\) states, and there are \(m\) choices for each element.

The maximum entropy of a system with \(n\) elements and \(m\) possible states can be calculated using the formula for entropy in the context of information theory or statistical mechanics:

H(X) = log(N) = log(m^n) = n log(m)


This formula indicates that the maximum entropy increases linearly with the number of elements (\(n\)) and logarithmically with the number of possible states (\(m\)). It shows that as the number of elements increases, the maximum entropy of the system also increases, and as the number of possible states increases, the maximum entropy increases at a slower rate.

It's important to note that this calculation assumes that all \(m^n\) states are equally probable, which might not be the case in a real system. The principle of maximum entropy is used to find the most unbiased or uninformed distribution, given a set of constraints or conditions [Source  0][Source  4].



## 43. The entropy of a system that is an association of independent systems.
let X and Y be two sets of descreet variables with a probability law 
H(X,Y) = - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Pxy)
H(x,y) = H(X) + H(Y|X) = H(Y) + H(X|Y)
if X and Y are independent then H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y)


## 44. Proof of the theorem on calculating the entropy of a system consisting of independent systems.

H(X,Y) = - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Pxy) = - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Pxy) =  - ∑ ∑ Px.Py|x log(Px.Py|x) =  - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Py|x)  - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Px) = H(Y|X) + H(X)
since X and Y are independent H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y)

## 45. Calculation of the total conditional entropy of systems.

H(X|Y) = - ∑Py ∑Px|y log(Px|y) = - ∑∑ Pxy log(Px|y)
H(X,Y) = - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Pxy) = - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Pxy) =  - ∑ ∑ Px.Py|x log(Px.Py|x) =  - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Py|x)  - ∑ ∑ Pxy log(Px) = H(Y|X) + H(X)

## 46. Proof of the theorem on the total conditional entropy of systems.

H(X|Y) = - ∑Py ∑Px|y log(Px|y) = - ∑∑ Pxy log(Px|y)

## 49. Additivity of the system. Examples.

The additivity of a system means that the entropy of a system composed of independent subsystems is equal to the sum of the entropies of these subsystems. In other words, if we have a system S consisting of subsystems A and B, the additivity of the system is expressed as follows:

H(S) = H(A) + H(B)

This implies that the subsystems A and B are independent of each other. If the subsystems are dependent, additivity may not hold, and instead, conditional entropy is used.

Examples:
1. **Two independent gases**
2. **Two independent computers**
3. **Two independent blocks of ice**
4. **Two independent quantities of information**


## 50. Equifinality in the theory of systems. Examples.

Equifinality in the theory of systems means that different systems can achieve the same final state (final state) through various paths or through different processes. This concept emphasizes that despite differences in initial conditions or structures of systems, they all can converge to a common final outcome.

Examples:
1. **Plant Growth:**
2. **Learning Processes:**
3. **Species Evolution:**
4. **Software Development:**
5. **Ecosystems:**
